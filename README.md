# Simple Bug Tracker - Client  
  
Angular17.  
Angular Material. 

Demonstrates both template driven and reactive forms.
Demonstrates custom pipe.
Demonstrates custom factory.

Config is stored in a local file (assets\config\config.json) so that config can be edited after a build has been created. This is in preference to using an environment.ts file to store the config which 'bakes it in' at compile time. 

To setup the client:  
Run npm i to install packages.  
Edit the API_URL key in the config.json (assets/config/config.json) to point at the back end.
